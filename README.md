# [hachem.cc](https://hachem.cc)
This is my personal website where I showcase some of my projects. I am no web-developer to say the least so I primarly used this repository as a learning experience. The front-end is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Threlte](https://threlte.xyz/). The website is still very much in its early stages but at this current point in time, I am happy with how it turned out, as the previous iteration was nothing short than unholy.

Hosted proudly using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
