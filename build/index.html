                question of &quot;who am I?&quot; much. I guess I&#39;m someone with a
                multitude of passions and interests. Music has been a part of my
                life from an early age. Computers and classical music have
                always fascinated me. Interestingly, my first foray into
                programming was with C, and it&#39;s amusing to realize that it&#39;s
                still my go-to language. I&#39;ve always had a knack for tinkering
                and breaking things; at home, they jokingly called me &quot;Mr.
                Break-It-All.&quot; I even managed to inadvertently render our
                family&#39;s first laptop useless by experimenting with an MBR
                overwrite in assembly code...<br><br>

                My youthful curiosity often led me to &quot;accidentally&quot; dismantle
                things in the pursuit of knowledge. Of course, lacking proper
                tools like soldering equipment or screwdrivers, I had to resort
                to more... creative methods. You could say I had a talent for
                finding unconventional solutions to my inquisitive dilemmas,
                much to the chagrin of our family&#39;s electronics.<br><br>

                Aside from my penchant for breaking things, my passion for music
                was evident from a very young age. I&#39;ve always been drawn to
                classical music over what some might call &quot;modern&quot; music. I
                delved into composition even before I could read sheet music,
                jotting down note names with little regard for rhythm. That&#39;s
                how I ended up composing a suite of pieces dedicated to people
                to whom I felt immense gratitude.<br><br>

                I suppose that I am a human being condemned to trying to make
                sense of life.</p></div></div> <div class="content-frame cs-frame svelte-1g1whcz" data-svelte-h="svelte-18lmaug"><div class="content-frame-data svelte-1g1whcz"><h1 class="svelte-1g1whcz">Computer Science</h1> <p class="svelte-1g1whcz">My technical history was no shy of breaking stuff. My upbringing
                originally was towards cyber security and &quot;hacking&quot;, first
                complete piece of software I wrote was an MBR overwrite. A
                couple of years later I got very involved with game development
                with Java. Made many, many, many games in java a long with a
                couple C++ game engines. I don&#39;t work on one specific type of
                software per say but I do have some degree of favoritism and
                that being of course, everything low level; all about kernel
                development, game engine development and all that lot. Below I
                provided some featured projects:</p> <div><div id="cs-container" class="svelte-1g1whcz"><p id="iridis-description" class="svelte-1g1whcz"><a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/Hachem-H/Iridis" id="cs-header" class="svelte-1g1whcz">Iridis</a> is an innovative programming language designed to cater
                        to the needs of various domains, such as computational physics,
                        kernel development, and game development, while remaining
                        versatile enough to be applicable in many other areas. This
                        language is built from the ground up to offer blazing fast
                        performance, a modern development experience, and low-level
                        control, empowering programmers to tackle complex problems

                        computer systems. Masquerading as an innocent-looking game,
                        it cleverly gains access through an installer that demands
                        administrative privileges for execution, just like legitimate
                        installers. While the installation process appears ordinary,
                        unbeknownst to the user, Excalibur secretly initiates a malicious
                        operation in the background.</p></div></div> <div id="cs-container" class="svelte-1g1whcz"><a id="cs-button" target="_black" href="https://github.com/Hachem-H/" class="svelte-1g1whcz">View more</a></div></div></div> <div class="content-frame mib-frame svelte-1g1whcz" data-svelte-h="svelte-1jrf7ce"><div class="content-frame-data svelte-1g1whcz"><h1 class="svelte-1g1whcz">Maths Visualizations</h1> <p class="svelte-1g1whcz">As a mathematician and a physicist, I tend to learn and study
                things that might seem rather counter intuitive, and often
                develop the urge to show the real beauty of a phenomena or
                subject to people who might not be mathematically inclined. This
                is why I decided to start a project; M.I.B. (Mathematics Is
                Beautiful), which is a youtube series full of visualizations
                about topics which I find are rather interesting. Below are some
